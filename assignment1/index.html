  <h1>Welcome to My Hobby Page</h1>
  <p>A <b>hobby</b> is a regular activity done <em>for enjoyment</em>, typically during one's leisure time, not professionally and not for pay. Hobbies include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. Participation in hobbies encourages acquiring substantial skills and knowledge in that area. A list of hobbies changes with renewed interests and developing fashions, making it diverse and lengthy. Hobbies tend to follow trends in society, for example stamp collecting was popular during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as postal systems were the main means of communication, while video games are more popular nowadays following technological advances. The advancing production and technology of the nineteenth century provided workers with more availability in leisure time to engage in hobbies. Because of this, the efforts of people investing in hobbies has increased with time.

  <h2><b>Bucket List</b></h2>
  <p>The term “bucket list” means <em>a list of all the goals you want to achieve, dreams you want to fulfill, and life experiences you wish to experience before you die.</em>If you don’t have a bucket list, I highly recommend you to create one. It will give you significant clarity in what you want from life. It’s an invaluable exchange.</p>
  </p>Here is a template of my bucket list-</p>
  <table>
  <tr id= "tableheader"><th> Things To Do</th>
	  <th> Till Age</th>
	  <th> Status</th>
  </tr>
  <tr class = "tabledata" ><td> Go on a road trip</td>
      <td> Before 20</td>
	  <td> Done</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class = "tabledata"><td> Sleep under the stars</td>
